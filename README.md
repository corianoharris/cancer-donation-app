## Components

### Button Component (`components/Button.tsx`)

## Key Implementation Details

- Uses `useMemo` for optimized performance on static data (animals, zoos, donation amounts)
- Implements `useForm` from react-hook-form for efficient form management
- Utilizes TypeScript for improved type safety
- Employs Tailwind CSS for styling
- Uses react-toastify for toast notifications
- Table with alternating row colors for better readability.

## Usage

1. Navigate to the cancer donation page in your browser
2. Select an cancer from the dropdown
3. Choose a cancer center from the dropdown
4. Select a donation amount
5. Click the "Submit Donation" button

## Development

To run the development server:

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Notes

- Ensure that your `layout.tsx` file is set up correctly to render the page content
- This application uses client-side rendering for interactive elements and server-side rendering for static components
- The purse balance is maintained in the component state and will reset on page refresh
